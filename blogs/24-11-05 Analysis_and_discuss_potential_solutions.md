# 24-11-05 Analysis and discuss potential solutions

## What I have done

- I made a table to analyse the pros and cons of a list of potential solutions.![image](/evidence/potential_solutions.png)
- I had a meeting with Alex, showed him the potential solutions I gathered and ask for his opinion. I wanted to go for the `monitor node` solution which is a more generic solution to `sensor failure` and leave room for future development.  However, he suggested me to start with `Association error in SLAM` because the change is relatively small and it is more urgent to solve the issue we currently have than implementing a generic solution.
  
## Reflection

- Having a table helped me compare solutions very effectively.
- Now that I have decided the solution I am implementing and i have looked back at all the blogs during the researching period, I feel i have not done a good job at identifying the issue, for example i should have broken down the `sensor faluire` topic into:
  - How to identify sensor failure (what information should i use)
  - How to react to sensor failure
  - How fast this solution needs to be
- I should have put more efforts into analysing the incident rather than rushing into finding a solutions.
- I always approach problems wanting to find the perfect solution, this have lead to me over think problems and ignore what is more urgent.

## What am I going to do?

- I will move on to coding the solution.
- I need to improve my way of approaching an issue, start from the simple solutions, get something working first before thinking how to improve the solution. I think following this, i will be able to understand the issue quicker, I can spent less time on thinking and more time on doing. Because I believe this is the reason I am behind the schedule in my initial proposal.
