# 25-02-27 Teamwork & therapy

## Description

This week I worked togeather with Marton a member from planning and control to implement the functions and classes we will be using to predict the location of the cones when we stop reciving Lidar signals, and we also implemented the ROS messages we will be using to communicate when such incident happens.

On top of working on those tasks project, I also went to therapy, where I shered the blogs I have been writing and told the therapist some of issue I have been facing, then I got dianosed with OCD lol.

## Feelings

I was very happy to work with developer form planning and control, we both get to exchange our knowladge and get to know other teams's ttack better, and since Marton is a new member this year, I also got to teach him some tricks and tips to improve his developing workflow, and this made me feel that I an not working on this project alone and I think this havs helped with my motivation.

As for the therapy, I feel I gained more understanding of myself after the session, and now looking back I did not realised how much pressure I have been puuting myself under. I am also very happy to have talked to someone and have figured things out. However I do not really understand OCD before this, So I am currently feeling kinda scare of it?

## Evaluation & Analysis

Working with Marton went very well, we were very well adn we were productive throughout, unlike when I was developing `Association Error`. I think that because Marton brought his knowladge from Planning and Control into this, he would tell me what kind of infomation they need so that I dont have to spent ages assuming and researching. On top pf that, I think Marton also learnt things such as the `ROS tf2` and how to implement it from me while we were working tograther, and I think this is a good demo of knowladge transfer between new and old members.

Going to the therapy sessions, I regained some of my motivation. I was able to make sence of why I was feeling the way I felt and not just get annoyed at stuff without understanding my emotion. For example, I would feel rewarded after achieving a goal and that keeps me going and when working on a long task, I need to feel constantly rewarded, however my OCD made me to aim very high and set goals could not easily achieve hence I lost my motivation from that.

## Conclusions

- It is a great way for knowladge transfer to parthered new and old member to work togeather.
- When working on a project across teams, getting members from ther other team would significantly boost effiency.
- Therapy is a good for when I feel stress and need someone to talk to.

## Action plan

- I will make the suggestion to other team lead to encourage cooperation between different sub-teams.
- In the future, when I encounter some issue, I should also seek advice from members in the other teams.
- Work on my communication skills when discribing situations and issues.
- Try meditation as suggested by my therapist.
