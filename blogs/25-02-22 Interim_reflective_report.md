# 25-02-22 Interim Reflective Report

## Description

This week I mainly focoused on witing the interim reflective report, I struggled a lot when I tried to put everything into the 5 different learning outcomes. I faild to deal with the competability issue I ran into when using pebblepad which I just decided to give up at the end because I was not meeting the deadline.

Also during the process I looked back at all the blogs I wrote then I realised their qualities varies and are decreasing. I have gotten to a point where I focoued too much on the technical aspect of the experience rather than my learning methods like the blogs are intended to do

## Feelings

I did not start writing the report until 5 days before the deadline, because thought it will be easy to summerise everyting into the report since I have got all the blogs written, so I did not have the motivation to start it earlier.

When I actually started the writing, I found it was actually a very difficult task to put everyting into the 5 learning outcome, and since I did not use pebblepad for blogging, I am not familiar with the tool, got very frustrated when trying to link my blogs. Then I thought since this report do not count towards our final grade I could get away with sending a half done report and get feedback for it, so I gave up at the end. Now looking back I am very disapointted at myself, bacause I just assumed the report will be easy and when I realised it is not, I gave up at the end.

As for the blogs, I feel quite unhappy how they turned out. Bacaue at the start I was so passionate and productive, but now it feels like I an losing my motivation.

## Evaluation & Analysis

Nothing really went well these two weeks when I was writing the report. Althought I have done it a lot during my studies, I always dislike writing tasks. Mainly because I struggle to put my thoughts into words in a structured way. I think this is why I underestimate how long it will take and kept procrasting to writing the report.

The reason I am slowly losing my motivation is that I didn't find this experience rewarding enough in terms of solving the real issue, it feels like I am stuck in an endless loop of researching and analysing and failing, dispite I am getting closer.  

## Conclusions

I feel like this entire 2 weeks shown how disorganised I can get when I lose motivation, I am usually not very good at I dentifying when I am at this stage and I would have got annoyed without understanding why things are not working out for me. I think writing things dowm like this enable be to get more intouch with my own thinking and feeling.

## Action plan

I have booked a therapy session and I hope that will help me better understand the things I have been feeling and find a way to regain my motivation.
