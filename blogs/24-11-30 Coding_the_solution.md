# 24-11-30 Coding the solution (last blog before exam)

## What I have done

![association_erroe_design_draft|700](/evidence/association_erroe_design_draft.png)

- I have design the program structure and logic as above (simplified)
- I tried to preserved the modularity in `map_lib` by implementing `template` I [learnt](24-11-22%20Understand_the_existing_code.md) while reading the code, so that we can swap between different implementations(kinda like interface in Java)

## Reflection

- This was a good exercise for my C++ skills, I wasn't very used to be thinking about referencing and copying when programming with other languages. But coding this have improve my understanding on that topic. On top of that i gain more experience in high performance programming.
- The whole process was quite smooth, think it is the effort i put into understanding the code before staring the task has paid off.
- But while i was working on this, I can't help but think about if it took me days to understand our current code, how hard it will be for new members to understand.
- Localisation and Mapping is already the hardest team to get new members to onboard due to the complex algorithm we implemented, I ment to improve the current onboarding tasks so that new members could join the development as soon as possible.

## What am I going to do?

- I have finished the implementation of the logic, the next step should be testing. But because it is now exam season and testing will involve other sub-teams, I think I will shift my focus to revision and wait for the next semester. And i would look into the more generic solution i proposed previously over the Christmas.
