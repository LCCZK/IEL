# 25-01-30 Still investigating and found some useful old code

## What I have done

- while going through our team fils, I came across an old infrastructure project that got abandoned due to the member left the team. The repo have very poor documentation and no one currently in the team knew about this.

## Reflection

- I was very frustrated when I found this package, although it doesn't work properly, but I could have develop my solution on top of this and would have save so many time..... this shows we have a very poor knowledge transfer process.
- This also shown that EUFS need a big clean-up, because there are many projects that no one is working on, and sometime we might be wasting member's time by only assigning them with new projects.

## What am I going to do?

- Improve the documentation in this package while trying to understand the implementation and make necessary changes.
- Raise concern to the other team-leads that we need a big "Clean up"
