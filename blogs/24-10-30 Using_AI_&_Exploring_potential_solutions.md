# 24-10-30 Using AI & Exploring potential solutions

## What I have done

- I used the paste week to research for potential solutions by reading papers and forums, reach out to other team members and professor.
- Explor potential solutions
  - The potential solutions I could implement to deal with `sensor faluire` are:
    1. Increase redundancy for input sources by adding extra sensors
    2. Publish cone association error in the SLAM node (suggestion by Alex)
    3. Use **ROS lifecycle node** to ensure all required nodes are running
    4. Built a **monitor node** to monitor output messages of other nodes, the monitor node need to output error messages when errors are detected so that each node could do some local adjustment.
    5. Implement visual odometry.
- Using AI to read papers
  - I had a very rough time reading academic papers due to my ADHD and I keep losing focus. Then my friend showed me how to use ChatGPT to summarise key points and prompt it to generate more engaging text.

## Reflection

- This is the first project at this scale in EUFS have the full control over, I am very used to having someone to tell me what to do and offer me assurance for my ideas. Without that I sometimes feel very insecure and unconfident about my solutions, led to a lots of self doubting and anxiety.
- I was quite reluctant to use AI at the start, maybe because I perceived using AI as a bad thing and it is banned or discouraged in lots of coursework, but it actually proved to be quite helpful in usecases such as summarising and paraphrasing, the experience i had with it was very mind opening and I am embarrassed that I had a closed mind towards AI technologies while studying for an AI&CS degree.

## What am I going to do?

- Be more confident and do not afraid to make mistake, this is how i will learn. And I need to get used to leading projects as soon as possible, this is because next year I will be the most senior member in the society.
- I do still think ChatGPT should not be used for every tasks as it perform well in literal tasks but it could always make mistake in logical tasks. But this should not be the reason for me to completely avoid to use ChatGPT and I should keep an open mind towards technologies.
