# 25-01-23 Investigate_system_monitor

## What I have done

- I went though an old package developed for ROS1 to get some ideas to implement our own version of that.
- [Link: ROS monitors](https://github.com/luhrts/monitoring/tree/devel/monitoring_monitors_ros)
- As mentioned in my [previous blog](25-01-15%20Testing_the_solution.md), I want to encourage workshops between different teams, so I organised a talk with Simulation team lead to introduce how our team member could test their software by themselves

## Reflection

- I realised there are many ROS packages already existed, but the maintenance is quite poor.
- My previous focus was mainly within the software aspect of the car, but this project involves many different aspect such as how to convert analogue signal, enable monitoring within ROS framework.
- Although this is outside of my comfort zone and is quite tricky (Which is why we didn't start with this solution), I feel like I am learning more.
- I think the talk went well, our members can now test their program in the simulated environment.
- Members even found bugs and provided feedbacks for the Simulation team, so i think these talks will be helpful for the entire software team.
  
## What am I going to do?

- Keep exploring the implementation about CAN(car area network)
- Design out version of system monitoring.
- keep organising talks between teams
