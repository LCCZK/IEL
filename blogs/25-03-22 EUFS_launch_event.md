## What I have done
I attended the EUFS launch event, I introduced the changes we have done this year and showed off the software performance. During the event, few students came to me and Alex to ask for advice to help them set up their new software team in their formula student society. At the stary I wasn't sure how much help we should give them, because they could be compeateting against us in the future.

## Reflection
I was focousing too much on the competition however ther are bigger to fry. Alex convinced me that this will be a good oppotunity to develope the formula student community, we want to share the things we have learnt so we can grow togeather in the future. So I did my best to share resources and point them to opened sourced projects what could be useful to them, and also gave them a glims of our developing projects.

## What am I going to do?
I think I want to engage in more events and projects involve the robotic community, to develope my professional skills. And I also need to look back at my past experience when I first started in formula student to identify what I can improve now and the things I whish I have known earlier, and share that with the community.
