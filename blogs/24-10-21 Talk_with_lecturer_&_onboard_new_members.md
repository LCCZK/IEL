# 24-10-21 Talk with lecturer & onboard new members

## What I have done

- In Mobile Robotic, I talked to the lecturer about this project I am working on. He offered an insight that i could add redundancy by using more sensors.
- in the past weeks, I mainly focused on onboarding new members by:
  - helping them set up Microsoft Teams, GitLab and team Wiki
  - Introduced them to ROS and our software design.
  - Assign relatively easier issues to new members, get them used to our workflow.
  
## Reflection

- I realised I am behind the schedule in my initial proposal because I underestimated the workload of being a team-lead, a treasurer and a year 3 student.
- I realised I have made too many commitments. In the future, I should really consider more carefully before commit to a responsibility.

## What am I going to do?

- I decided to use calendar more seriously, as it does help me to plan my free time in between lectures and get tasks done.
- I am looking for a replacement for my treasurer role in Ultimate Frisbee, once that is done I should have more free time during the week.
- So overall, I need to improve my time management skills by plan by day better.
- Talking to professors is actually a good way getting ideas, I think I should do this more to explore potential solutions.
