# LO3: Recognising and Developing Skills

I am able to demonstrate how I have used experiences during my SLICC to critically develop my skills in the focussed area of:

- [x] research and enquiry
- [ ] personal and intellectual autonomy
- [ ] communication
- [ ] personal effectiveness

## Final Reflective Report

In my proposal, I chose to focus on developing my problem-solving skills from the research and enquiry skill set. When approaching my topic on sensor failure at the start, I had this misconception that solutions should always come from academic papers. Therefore, I forced myself to read many papers. However, I was reading papers without any strategy. I soon realised that this approach was not practical. I would [get overwhelmed](https://github.com/LCCZK/IEL/blob/main/blogs/24-10-30%20Using_AI_%26_Exploring_potential_solutions.md) by the amount of information and complexity, which made me feel like I was wasting my time.

Consulting my friend who is a PhD student, he taught me that it is essential to keep clear objectives in mind before any research. When reading a paper, I should start from the abstract and conclusion to predict whether a paper would contain infomation to anwser my objectives, and sometimes, it is ok to use AI tools to help me summarise the content. Following his advice, I started to make checklists for questions and objectives I wanted information about before reading any papers. I also tried ChatGPT despite my initial negative opinion about [using AI](https://github.com/LCCZK/IEL/blob/main/blogs/24-10-30%20Using_AI_%26_Exploring_potential_solutions.md). I found it very helpful in summarising the content of papers while using engaging language to keep me interested. This experiment surely changed my impression of AI and got me to reflect on my previous close-minded thoughts. However, in the future, I should still keep exploring ways to read papers independently without relying on AI tools, as they are not always available and 100% reliable.

In addition to paper reading skills, I also developed skills to recognise valuable resources available to help me with my research. As I mentioned above, before my SLICC, I had the belief that academic papers were the only reliable source of information. However, I have come to realise that there are many other resources that can be just as valuable, if not more valuable. For example, [talking to professors in the field](https://github.com/LCCZK/IEL/blob/main/blogs/24-10-21%20Talk_with_lecturer_%26_onboard_new_members.md) and [brainstorming with my peers](https://github.com/LCCZK/IEL/blob/main/blogs/25-02-08%20Evaluate_solutions.md) can sometimes provide more insights than reading papers. I came to this conclusion in my two attempts to develop a solution for sensor failure. The first solution I implemented was based on a paper I found. Still, it turned out to be ineffective due to conflict with the existing algorithm we are using in EUFS. After discussing with my peers and professors, I was able to come up with a more practical solution that worked better in our specific context. This experience taught me the importance of being open-minded and exploring different sources of information.

On top of the aforementioned skills, I also discovered the need to improve my [skills to identify and phrase my questions](https://github.com/LCCZK/IEL/blob/main/blogs/25-02-08%20Evaluate_solutions.md). I noticed that I would sometimes forget why I was asking a question and what I was trying to achieve. This is especially true when I am asking questions in a group setting or a brief exchange, where I often feel the need to ask questions quickly without taking the time to think about how to phrase them. As a result, my questions can sometimes be vague or unclear, leading to confusion, miscommunication, and not getting the answers I need.
