- [x] outlook and engagement

## Final Reflective Report

When writing my proposal, I misunderstood the scope of this learning outcome. I thought it was about developing a positive mindset towards my SLICC project. However, as my SLECC progressed, I realised it was more about developing my mindset towards the communities and world around me. Therefore, midway through my SLICC, I shifted to focus on the development of this mindset towards the robotics community and started to attend community events.

I came from a background where the concept of a community was taught in a very abstract way, focusing on collectivism, harmony, and national unity. My initial understanding of engaging with a community means respecting the authority and elders, putting community interest over individual interest and contributing to society and nation-building. Therefore, although I had a great interest in robotics, I was also scared of the complexity and not being good enough to be accepted by the local communities. I was afraid that the skills I possessed would not be enough to contribute or get me involved in anything meaningful. So, overall, as much as I was keen on robotics, I was not confident about engaging with the robotics community. 

[Attending the Edinburgh Robotic Meetup]() was the first step I took to explore the robotic community. Differing from my expectation of a formal event, it was very casual in a local pub meetup for people to share their projects, and despite attendees being mostly senior researchers and engineers in the industry, they were very friendly and welcoming to us. After I shared our autonomous driving software, not only did they show genuine interest by asking many questions, but they also gave me guidance on what we could improve in the future. This and a few of the following meetings made me realise the local community is not as scary and complex as I initially thought. I could share my ideas, get suggestions and make connections here. I do not have to sacrifice my individual thinking to "fit in" with the community, but rather, diverse thinking is more appreciated and leads to constructive discussion here.

On top of this, I used to think that to be able to contribute to the robotic community, I would have to be an authority figure or elder who engaged in research work and published papers, and as a senior, I would have to do what I was told. However, [helping students from the University of St Andrew]() set up their formula student software teams changed my mind. Initially, I did not understand why we were helping another formula student team who would be our rivals in the future, then Alex told me to look back on how we initially started on robotics from formula students, how there was a lack of communities for people from different teams to learn and grow together. I understood that we were not helping other people so we could win in formula students. We are helping so that our community can grow bigger in the future, and I do not have to be an elder to do that.

The next step for this learning outcome is to engage in an open sourced ROS project by signing up for Google Summer of Code to contribute to the robotic communities, explore more communities, such as climbing and photography, the activities I am interested in and enjoy doing. Ever since I developed the understanding of the local community, I found myself more active during discussions and keen to attend social events which I rarely did in the past. I believe this will be significant for my personal development and mental health.


<!-- When writing my proposal, I misunderstood the scope of this learning outcome. I thought it was about developing a positive mindset towards my SLICC project. However, as my SLECC progressed, I realised it was more about developing my mindset towards the communities and world around me. Therefore, midway through my SLICC, I shifted to focus on the development of my outlook and engagement mindset towards the robotics community. Despite my initial misunderstanding, it was not hard to tell from my text that the image I had of the robotics community was very shallow. I had a great interest in robotics, but I was also scared of its complexity and the electronic engineering side. I was afraid that the skills I possessed would not be enough to get me involved in anything meaningful. So overall, as much as I was keen on robotics, I was confident about engaging with the community. Three occasions that led to the most significant development of this mindset took place when I met other robotic engineers during events.

Attending the Edinburgh Robotic Meetup with friends was the first step I took to explore the robotic community. Differing from my expectation of a formal event, it was very casual in a local pub meetup for people to share their projects, and despite attendees being mostly senior researchers and engineers in the industry, they were very friendly and welcoming to us. The simple fact of being able to understand their topic and engage in conversations brought me a lot of confidence, and we also received lots of compliments and guidance when we shared our autonomous driving software. I reflect on this experience and realise that I was too focused on how hard the technical side of robotics is and forgot that every expert started from the same point as me. I should not be afraid to engage with the community to seek help. I would not have learnt this if I had not attended community events like this, and it taught me that I should not judge a community based on my own limited experience, assumption, and imagination because it will likely lead to misjudgement.

The second interaction happened between me and students from St Andrews University, who were just setting up their formula student software team and were seeking advice. I was told that I should hold back on how much information I share because they could become our rivals in the future. However, I looked back on how I initially started on Formula Student and how much I hoped there was a community for people in different teams to learn and grow together; I brought up the idea that we should help other teams as much as we can to encourage the development of this community. After that, we agreed to open source more parts of our software, so other teams could use it as a reference or a starting point.  -->

<!-- ## What -->
<!-- 
In your own words, what are you focusing on for this learning outcome? Make this as specific as possible. How does this differ from what you expected in your Proposal?

What have you done since your Proposal to progress this learning outcome?

What unexpected changes, challenges and/or problems have you encountered?

 I got to talk to a hire manager for robotic companies, I share my frustration in most of th job oppotunities are for people with PhD or years of experience. He confirmed that it is the current trend in the UK robotic industry, but he also stated that the industry is growing rapidly, and there will be more opportunities for graduates in the future when I graduate.

 He also said the experices and skills I gained from EUFS are the exactly what the industry will be looking for, and I should not be discouraged by the current situations.
