# Learning Abstract
<!-- 
- A brief outline of why you initially chose your experience
- What you wanted to learn about through this experience
- A short overview of your learning journey what you have learnt along the way, including what you may have anticipated, and what was unexpected.

<!-- Edinburgh University Formula Student(EUFS) is a student society focoused on autonomous formula cars racing, the Hardware group design and manufacture the formula cars and the software group develop autonomous driving software. My SLICC took place during my third year in the society working as the Localisation and Mapping team-lead in the software teams while I focused on investigating an incident caused by Lidar failure and developing solutions to react to sensor failure.

I chose the experience because I believe it would help me better understand the structure of an autonomous driving system, how components in different subteams were working togeather and identify improvement we can make in the future. Also, I am very interested in robotic engineering and want to improve skills to prepare me for a career in this field.

My learning journey on this topic can be split into few stages. Modelled the incident, I learnt the cause of the incident, the structure of the software stack and the behaviour of different compoments when Lidar failure happened. I researched the issue and came up with potential solutions which I could implemente. `Cone association error` was the first solution I implemented tried to adress sensor failure, which I realised it was not effective when testing. After further research and discussions I implemented `pose prediction` which improved our software's behaviour when encountering `Lidar failure` like what happened in the incident last year, but it is not a generic solution to `sensor failure` like I initially hoped. -->

## Timeline

`S1 Week 3 - 4` Study/Analysis the issue

<!-- - I tried to identify the proproties of sensor failure. During to process I had meetings with other team-leads, gained a better understanding of the software structure and I also improved some documentations during the process. -->

[S1W4](../blogs/24-10-09%20Identify_scope_of_the_issue_2.md)

`S1 Week 5 - 9` Research potential solution

<!-- - At this stage, I met with people, read papers and forums to came up with potential solutions.
- I used to have very negative openion about using AI, but it helped me when I was struggling to read papers. -->
