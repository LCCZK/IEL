# LO5: Evaluation

I am able to evaluate and critically reflect upon my approach, my learning, my development and my judgement throughout my SLICC.

## Final Reflective Report

Before my SLICC, I would occasionally reflect on my learning approach when things did not go the way I expected. I would try to identify what I have done wrong. However, the entire process happened only in my mind, and I also lacked action planning, which led to inefficiency in personal and skill development because I did not have a clear goal to work towards, which meant most of my reflection would end up being forgotten. I began to keep frequent reflective blogs and tried to use reflective models in these blogs during my SLICC.

For the first half of my SLICC, I followed the "What? So what? Now what?" model when writing my reflective blogs. This was quite challenging at the start because I was not used to keeping consistent blogs and putting my thoughts into words. These situations got better as I wrote more blogs. The "Now what" section got me started to think about action plans and the specific things I wanted to achieve in the future. The process of putting my thinking into words forced me to organise my thinking, which deepened my understanding of the events I was reflecting on. 

However, I found myself struggling to write blogs when everything went as I expected. It was not until I started to follow Gibbs' reflective cycle that I realised that when I reflect on my experience, I put too much focus on identifying what went wrong rather than focusing on the experience itself. I was missing the opportunities to ask questions such as "What went well ?", "what did I do to make things go well ?" and "Should I keep doing what I did, or is there still room for improvement?". This is because when I was following the "What? So what? Now what?" model, the prompts were relatively more abstract and similar enough for me not to change the way I reflect, and I could simply fit my reflection into this framework. When I switched to Gibbs' reflective cycle, which is structurally more different, I had to reflect on my reflection process to learn what I mentioned above.

After switching to Gibbs' reflective cycle, the feelings section got me to dig into my emotions and identify the reasons behind my feeling unmotivated, mainly due to mental burnout. I started to pay more attention to my mental health by engaging in therapy and meditation, and I have spent some time stepping away from all the work after I ended my research on my topic. When I came back, I immediately realised I was more energetic when writing this report. My thought process has become smoother, and I am more productive.

This experience demonstrated to me how vital and powerful the skill of reflection is. This approach to learning will be very useful in my day-to-day life; it will help me to keep in touch with my feelings when I learn from my past experiences and improve my self-awareness. I am planning to keep applying this reflective learning approach after the end of my SLICC and try other reflection models in order to find or develop a model that is more suitable for me.
